For I say to you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.  And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him, and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?</p>

<p>But he said to him: What is written in the law? how readest thou?  He answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself.  And he said to him: Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.  But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbour?  And Jesus answering, said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead.</p>

<p>And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way: and seeing him, passed by.  In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.  But a certain Samaritan being on his journey, came near him; and seeing him, was moved with compassion.  And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  And the next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee.</p>

<p>Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?  But he said: He that shewed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.</p>

<p>Vade, et fac similiter.</p>

I can&rsquo;t find the Rev. Hole book this afternoon.  Hopefully it will turn up soon!</p>

<p>At that time, Jesus going out of the coasts of Tyre, came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. And they bring to Him one deaf and dumb, and they besought Him that He would lay His hand upon him. And taking him from the multitude apart, He put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, He groaned and said to him: Ephphetha, which is, Be thou opened: and immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right. And He charged them that they should tell no man: but the more He charged them so much the more a great deal did they publish it; and so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</p>

We had this in my primary school &ndash; a year six student would read it out over the public address system everyday at noon.  In the Philippines it would be said over the radio.  In medieval times the church bell would remind people for miles around to take a moment to pray.</p>

<p>In Easter time it is replaced by Regina Caeli (O Queen of Heaven rejoice!) which has music, but the rest of the year we usually just say it.</p>

<p>℣ Angelus Domini nuntiavit Mariae;
℟ Et concepit de Spiritu Sancto.
Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.
℣ Ecce ancilla Domini.
℟  Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum.
Ave Maria, gratia plena,&hellip;
℣ Et Verbum caro factum est.
℟  Et habitavit in nobis.
Ave Maria, gratia plena,&hellip;
℣ Ora pro nobis, sancta Dei Genetrix.
℟  Ut digni efficiamur promissionibus Christi.
Oremus:
Gratiam tuam, quaesumus, Domine, mentibus nostris infunde; ut qui, Angelo nuntiante, Christi Filii tui incarnationem cognovimus, per passionem eius et crucem, ad resurrectionis gloriam perducamur. Per eundem Christum Dominum nostrum.
℟  Amen.</p>

<p>℣ The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary;
℟ And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our death. Amen.
℣ Behold the handmaid of the Lord:
℟  Be it done unto me according to Thy word.
Hail Mary, full of grace, &hellip;
℣ And the Word was made flesh:
℟  And dwelt among us.
Hail Mary, full of grace, &hellip;
℣ Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
℟  That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
Let us pray:
Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we, to whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His passion and cross be brought to the glory of His resurrection, through the same Christ our Lord.
℟  Amen.</p>

<p>There are settings to sing the Angelus.  Here is one by Dom Charpentier OSB.  He uses a common antiphon tune in mode 4.  Sheet music <a href="http://lalemantpolyphonic.org/05_temp_Psalm_tone_samples/angelus_sung_PDF.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Soul of my Savior sanctify my breast,
Body of Christ, be thou my saving guest,
Blood of my Savior, bathe me in thy tide,
wash me with waters gushing from thy side.</p></blockquote>

<p>Strength and protection may thy passion be,
O blessèd Jesus, hear and answer me;
deep in thy wounds, Lord, hide and shelter me,
so shall I never, never part from thee.</p>

<p>Guard and defend me from the foe malign,
in death&rsquo;s dread moments make me only thine;
call me and bid me come to thee on high
where I may praise thee with thy saints for ay.</p>

Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican. The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give Thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers; as also is this publican. I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess. And the Publican standing afar off would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven, but struck his breast saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner. I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/communion-of-saints.jpg" alt="communion-of-saints" />This is a well known hymn.  It is based on the Ambrosian hymn <em>Te Deum</em>, a hymn of thanksgiving &ndash; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUUvCxxsuY">here is a recording of Giovani Vianini jamming on the organ</a>.  But I&rsquo;m wandering &ndash; this is the vernacular hymn of the week post.</p>

<p>The <em>Te Deum</em> was anonymously paraphrased into German but later attributed to Ignaz Franz, then translated into English by Clarence Walworth from New York.  I&rsquo;ve heard that it is the standard post-benediction hymn in the United States.</p>

<p>Liturgically, there are times when the Te Deum is not sung, in times with a more penitential flavour like Lent, so Holy God is not quite a &ldquo;hymn for all seasons&rdquo;.  But pretty close.</p>

<blockquote><p>Holy God, we praise Thy Name;
Lord of all, we bow before Thee!
All on earth Thy scepter claim,
All in Heaven above adore Thee;
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.</p>

<p>Lo! the apostolic train
Join the sacred Name to hallow;
Prophets swell the loud refrain,
And the white robed martyrs follow;
And from morn to set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.</p>

<p>Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.</p>

<p>Thou art King of glory, Christ:
Son of God, yet born of Mary;
For us sinners sacrificed,
And to death a tributary:
First to break the bars of death,
Thou has opened Heaven to faith.</p>

<p>From Thy high celestial home,
Judge of all, again returning,
We believe that Thou shalt come
In the dreaded doomsday morning;
When Thy voice shall shake the earth,
And the startled dead come forth.</p>

<p><em>Therefore do we pray Thee, Lord:
Help Thy servants whom, redeeming
By Thy precious blood out-poured,
Thou hast saved from Satan’s scheming.
Give to them eternal rest
In the glory of the blest.</em></p>

<p>Spare Thy people, Lord, we pray,
By a thousand snares surrounded:
Keep us without sin today,
Never let us be confounded.
Lo, I put my trust in Thee;
Never, Lord, abandon me.</p>

<p>*This verse a later addition by Hugh T. Henry.</p>

I&rsquo;ve mentioned the <a href="http://brandt.id.au/music/te-lucis-ante-terminum/">hymn for Compline earlier</a>.  We did try singing Prime from the regular Divine Office, but found it a bit difficult.  Instead we settled on the Little Office version.  It&rsquo;s the same each day, with minor seasonal variations for Advent and Christmas.</p>

<p>The Divine Office has different hymns for each hour: Jam Lucis for Prime, Nunc Sancte Nobis for Terce, Rector Potens for Sext, Rerum Deus for None and Te Lucis for Compline.  Matins, Lauds and Vespers have different hymns for each day of the week and different feast days and seasons.  The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary has much fewer hymns and most of them to the one tune.</p>

<p>This is the hymn for Prime, Terce, Sext, None and Compline:</p>

<p>Memento, rerum Conditor,
Nostri quod olim corporis,
Sacrata ab alvo Virginis
Nascendo formam sumpseris.</p>

<p>Maria, Mater gratiæ,
Dulcis parens clementiæ,
Tu nos ab hoste protege
Et mortis hora suscipe.</p>

<p>Jesu, tibi sit gloria,
Qui natus es de Virgine,
Cum Patre, et almo Spiritu,
In sempiterna sæcula. Amen.</p>

<p>Remember, O Creator Lord,
that in the Virgin&rsquo;s sacred womb
Thou wast conceived, and of her flesh
didst our mortality assume.</p>

<p>Mother of grace, O Mary blest,
to thee, sweet fount of love, we fly;
shield us through life, and take us hence
to thy dear bosom when we die.</p>

<p>O Jesu! born of Mary bright!
Immortal glory be to Thee;
praise to the Father infinite,
and Holy Ghost eternally. Amen.</p>

<p>Matins and Lauds have slightly longer hymns, but same tune.</p>

<p>Some collections of chant have a shorter version, just taking the last two verses of Memento, as sung in this clip from youtube:</p>

<p>So, for singing along, here is the sheet music: <a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MementoRerum.pdf">MementoRerum</a>
You might remember last weeks diversion into the differences in chant hymns introduced by Pope Urban VIII.  Here is the earlier, medieval wording: <a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MementoSalutis.pdf">MementoSalutis</a>.  Which is also the same wording that William Byrd used in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=722E-rjD5Nw">a beautiful polyphonic arrangement</a>.</p>

<p>Those pages are from a book I was working on which is up at <a href="http://github.com/veromary/littleOffice">github/veromary/littleOffice</a>.  A booklet with Prime and Compline from the little office, plus the text of the Gospel Canticles, Benedictus and Magnificat.  For a recording of our family singing compline from these books see <a href="http://repleatur.net/2012/10/10/compline-from-the-little-office-of-bvm/">Compline from the Little Office</a> over at my choir blog.</p>
