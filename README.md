# veromary.github.io

This one really needs an overhaul.  I'm leaving it up although all the links are broken.  I can't believe how careless I am with keeping files!

I was having a go at posting a worksheet about the Sunday Mass readings on a regular basis.

Right now the better directory of where I am is veronica.brandt.id.au
