And His disciples answered Him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness? And He asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven. And He commanded the people to sit down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, He broke and gave to His disciples to set before the people. And they had a few little fishes, and He blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them. And they did eat, and were filled; and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets: and they that had eaten were about four thousand: and He sent them away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WHole013.jpg"><img src="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WHole013-219x300.jpg" alt="WHole013" /></a>This time picking a hymn for a feast day coming up this week: The Nativity of St John the Baptist.  The timing matches in with the feasts of the Annunciation (when Elizabeth was in her 6th month) 25th March, and the Nativity of Our Lord &ndash; 25th December.  Most saints&#8217; feast days commemorate the day of their death (or birth into eternal life), except Our Lord, our Lady and St John the Baptist.  What do they have in common? They were all born without original sin!  St John Baptist was conceived with original sin, but his encounter with Jesus in utero was his own baptism.</p>

<p>The corresponding <a href="http://brandt.id.au/music/ut-queant-laxis/">chant of the week</a> post has an English hymn which is a better fit for the feast, but not as commonly sung in English.  It tells more the story of the actual birth of St John.  Another tack could have been to look at the Canticle the Bendictus.</p>

<p>Instead I&rsquo;ve picked the first hymn in the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/richard-terry/old-westminster-hymnal/paperback/product-16796174.html">Old Westminster Hymnal</a>, a hymn more for Advent, but still a beautiful reflection on the role of St John the Baptist.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hark, a herald voice is calling;
“Christ is nigh,” it seems to say;
“Cast away the dreams of darkness,
O ye children of the day.”</p></blockquote>

<p>2 Startled at the solemn warning,
Let the earthbound soul arise;
Christ her Sun, all sloth dispelling,
Shines upon the morning skies.</p>

<p>3 Lo, the Lamb so long expected,
Comes with pardon down from heav’n;
Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,
One and all to be forgiv’n.</p>

<p>4 So when next He comes with glory,
Shrouding all the earth in fear,
May He then as our defender,
On the clouds of heav’n appear.</p>

<p>5 Honour, glory, virtue, merit,
To the Father and the Son,
With the co-eternal Spirit
While eternal ages run.</p>

<p>Tr. Edward Caswall, 1814–75</p>

Great time to bring up the origins of &ldquo;Do Re Mi&rdquo;.  A great intro is this <a href="http://choirly.com/names-of-the-notes-ut-queant-laxis/">exclusive interview with Guido d&#8217;Arezzo</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the sheet music for the Vespers hymn of the Nativity of St John the Baptist.</p>

<p><a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/utqueant.pdf">utqueant.pdf</a>
<a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/utqueant.gabc">utqueant.gabc</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added in the translation from <a href="http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Ut_queant_laxis">CPDL</a> &ndash; though they have an extra verse that isn&rsquo;t in the vespers hymn in the Liber Usualis, but it is in the Laudes hymn..  But good as a bare bones literal translation.</p>

<p>Below is the text as in the Liber, plus a versified translation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ut queant laxis resonáre fibris
Mira gestórum fámuli tuórum,
Solve pollúti lábii reátum,
Sancte Joánnes.</p></li>
<li><p>Núntius celso véniens Olýmpo
Te patri magnum fore nascitúrum,
Nomen, et vitae sériem geréndae
Ordinae promit.</p></li>
<li><p>Ille promíssi dúbius supérni,
Pérdidit promptae módulos loquélae:
Sed reformásti genitus perémptae
Organa vocis.</p></li>
<li><p>Ventris obstrúso récubans cubíli
Sénseras Regem thálamo manéntem:
Hinc parens nati méritis utérque
Abdita pandit.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit decus Patri, genitaéque Proli
Et tibi, compar utriúsque virtus,
Spíritus semper, Deus unus, omni
Témporis aevo. Amen.</p></li>
<li><p>O for your spirit, holy John, to chasten
Lips sin-polluted, fettered tongues to loosen;
So by your children might your deeds of wonder
Meetly be chanted.</p></li>
<li><p>Lo! a swift herald, from the skies descending,
Bears to your father promise of your greatness;
How he shall name you, what your future story,
Duly revealing.</p></li>
<li><p>Scarcely believing message so transcendent,
Him for a season power of speech forsaketh,
Till, at your wondrous birth, again returneth,
Voice to the voiceless.</p></li>
<li><p>You, in your mother&rsquo;s womb all darkly cradled,
Knew your great Monarch, biding in His chamber,
Whence the two parents, through their offspring&rsquo;s merits,
Mysteries uttered.</p></li>
<li><p>Praise to the Father, to the Son begotten,
And to the Spirit, equal power possessing,
One God whose glory, through the lapse of ages,
Ever resounding. Amen.</p></li>
</ol>

Looks like they typed up the words from <a href="http://musicasacra.com/2007/12/28/britts-hymns-of-the-breviary-and-missal/">The Hymns of the Missal and Breviary by Michael Britt</a>, partially transcribed <a href="http://www.cathcorn.org/hotbam/">here</a>.

Plate 28 by William Hole RSA. Always associated with the Beatitudes.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s Gospel focusses on another part of the discourse &ndash; the warning against bearing anger.  No matter how long you nurse a grudge, it doesn&rsquo;t get better.  A good admonition on approaching the altar too.  The disciples on Mt Thabor would have understood him in the context of the temple sacrifices.  Today it seems to point to preparing for Communion &ndash; but could go for any prayer.  And since we should pray always, we need to forgive always.</p>

<p>Here is the text of the day&rsquo;s Gospel:</p>

<p><a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sermononmountbw.jpg"><img src="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sermononmountbw-300x251.jpg" alt="sermon on the mount" /></a> At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: Except your justice abound more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother: Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say: Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother hath anything against thee, leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to thy brother; and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift</p>

<blockquote><p>vade prius reconciliari fratri tuo:</p></blockquote>

<p>go first to be reconciled to thy brother</p>

<p>And here is the copywork/colouring in page to print out:</p>

<p><a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pentecost05.pdf">Pentecost05</a></p>

Murder, slander, court, fire breathing dragon and the man leaving his gift at the altar to go be reconciled.</p>

<p>Anger should be restrained, Compescitur iracundia.  From <a href="http://catholic-resources.org/Art/Nadal.htm">Gospel Illustrations by Jerome Nadal SJ</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.  God bless you and I hope you have a great weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s the page from my hymnbook: <a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ubicaritas.pdf">ubicaritas</a>.  I haven&rsquo;t forgotten about making it available.  The latest development has been putting it up <a href="https://github.com/veromary/Congregavit">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m having trouble finding the ideal recording.  Yes, I should have got my family to sing it, but they&rsquo;re all in bed, approximately, and I want to get this done tonight, and lots of kids with sore throats right now anyway, so here&rsquo;s the closest.  The monks are singing the possibly more correct words &ldquo;Ubi caritas est vera&rdquo; (where charity is true) but the screen still gives the more widespread &ldquo;Ubi caritas et amor&rdquo; (where charity and love are).  The <a href="http://www.brandt.id.au/music/hymnbook/">New Book of Old Hymns</a> uses the vera version, but the excerpt above uses the amor version.</p>

<p>For lyrics and translation see <a href="http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/UbiCaritas.html">Thesaurus Precum Latinarum</a>.  (Thesaurus means Treasury &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that cool?)</p>

<p>And when you have enjoyed the straight chant version, check out the Durufle version and the one from the Royal Wedding.  Lots of beautiful arrangments out there.  I remember hearing one on the radio, a rather modern one, but it generally moved from dissonance towards a melody rather like the regular chant version.  I haven&rsquo;t been able to track it down, so please jump in and comment if you have any clues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://americaneedsfatima.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/why-devotion-to-immaculate-heart-is-so.html"><img src="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tfp-242x300.png" alt="tfp" /></a>This is one of my favourite hymns.  Alright, I probably say that a lot, but I mean it.  The words are from an Irish protestant minister called F. W. Wetherell, who I wrote about <a href="http://veromarybrrr.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/mystery-hymn-writers-solved/">here</a>.  The tune is from the amazing Johann Sebastian Bach, another protestant.  So this hymn sort of laid low in the times when Catholic hymnbooks only carried Catholic authors and composers.  And it was too Marian for most Protestant hymnbooks too, so it sort of slid through the cracks.</p>

<p>The current liturgical calendar places the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the Saturday following the Sacred Heart of Jesus &ndash; or last Saturday.  The 1962 calendar places it on the 22nd August.  Whichever way you go, any day is a good day to pray to Mary, our Mother in heaven.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mary immaculate, star of the morning,
Chosen before the creation began,
Chosen to bring for thy bridal adorning,
Woe to the serpent and rescue to man.</p></blockquote>

<p>2 Here in an orbit of shadow and sadness
Veiling thy splendour, thy course thou hast run;
Now thou art throned in all glory and gladness,
Crowned by the hand of thy Saviour and Son.</p>

<p>3 Sinners, we worship thy sinless perfection;
Fallen and weak, for thy pity we plead;
Grant us the shield of thy sovereign protection,
Measure thine aid by the depth of our need.</p>

<p>4 Frail is our nature and strict our probation,
Watchful the foe that would lure us to wrong;
Succour our souls in the hour of temptation,
Mary immaculate, tender and strong.</p>

<p>5 See how the wiles of the serpent assail us,
See how we waver and flinch in the fight;
Let thine immaculate merit avail us,
Make of our weakness a proof of thy might.</p>

<p>6 Bend from thy throne at the voice of our crying,
Bend to this earth which thy footsteps have trod;
Stretch out thy hand to us living and dying,
Mary immaculate, Mother of God.</p>

<p>The gospel reading for EF Masses this Sunday is Luke 5:</p>

<p><a href="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pente4colour2.jpg"><img src="http://brandt.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Pente4colour2-213x300.jpg" alt="Pente4colour2" /></a></p>

<blockquote><p>And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth, [2] And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. [3] And going into one of the ships that was Simon&#8217; s, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship. [4] Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. [5] And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have labored all the night, and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.</p></blockquote>

<p>[6] And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes, and their net broke. [7] And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking. [8] Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus&#8217; knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. [9] For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken. [10] And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon&#8217; s partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p>

<p>[11] And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him.</p>

There are also no references for where the paintings come from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a hymn by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McAuley">James McAuley</a>, so I should ask permission before posting lyrics.  There once was a webpage with all his poetry online by arrangement with <a href="http://curtisbrown.com.au/">the estate</a>, but looks like it closed.</p>

<p>The music is by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Connolly">Richard Connolly</a>.</p>

<p>It is in the old Living Parish Hymnbooks and Hymns for the Year of Faith.  I&rsquo;d love to see these reprinted.</p>

<p>The Clementine Vulgate has: &ldquo;Gaudium erit coram Angelis Dei&rdquo; which the Douay Rhiems, Challoner translates as: &ldquo;There shall be joy before the angels of God&rdquo; but coram is to do with the heart isn&rsquo;t it? Would the literal translation be more like: The hearts of the Angels of God will be glad? This is why I need to study Latin more.</p>

<p>[Edit: I am assured that coram does indeed mean &ldquo;before&rdquo;, so the regular Douay Rhiems is quite literal as usual.]</p>

I didn&rsquo;t notice this before, but each picture is labelled with letters with explanations of the significance of each down the bottom.  These are great pictures.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>Locus, ubi fuerat Ioannes baptizans, ad Betharabam trans Iordanem.
(the place where John Baptised, at Betharabam across the Jordan?)</p></li>
<li><p>IESUS cum discipulis. (Jesus with disciples)</p></li>
<li><p>Accedunt ad IESUM publicani, et peccatores, ut eum audiant. (The publicans and sinners go to Jesus and they listen to him.)</p></li>
<li><p>Obmurmurant Pharisaei, et Scribae idque fastidiunt. (The scribes and pharisees murmur&hellip;)</p></li>
<li><p>Nonaginta oves ad caulas relictae in deserto, una perdita. (The ninety sheep in the sheepfold, one lost)</p></li>
<li><p>Pastor inquirit ovem oberrantem. (Shepherd searches for the lost sheep.)</p></li>
<li><p>Inuentam reportat humeris ad ovile gaudens. (&hellip;. to the sheep, happy.)</p></li>
<li><p>Domum rediens, convocat, et invitat ad congratulandum amicos. (Goes to the house, invites his friends to congratulate/rejoice.)</p></li>
<li><p>Accensa lucerna mulier evertit domum, et inquirit acclimam drachmam amissam. (A woman looking for the missing drachma)</p></li>
<li><p>Inuenta ea, convocat amicas, et invitat ad sibi congratulandum. (Calling friends together to rejoice.)</p></li>

<p>And I need to study Latin more!
Please help me out here in the com box if you can.</p>
